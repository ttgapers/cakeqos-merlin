# CakeQOS-Merlin

## Pre-requisites
1.  Currently only supports RT-86U & RT-AX88U running [Melin firmware](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng) (384.xx and above)
2.  Not recommended for connection up/down of 250Mbps or higher. **Note:** Users with higher up/down connections have reported lower peaks but better stability and user experience overall and continue to use Cake.
3.  Disable QoS (any) - probably best to go to Admin/Privacy and "Withdraw" to be sure (note disables other stuff too)
4.  Entware
5.  USB Storage
6.  jffs

## Tips
1.  If you use connections like ADSL, VDSL, Docsis, learn about the overhead keyword. [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-cake.8.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-cake.8.html)
2.  If you want to understand and change Priority Queue Parameters. [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-cake.8.html#PRIORITY_QUEUE_PARAMETERS](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-cake.8.html#PRIORITY_QUEUE_PARAMETERS)
3.  Use 90-95% of your line speed as upload/download limits

## Install Example

1.  Run the installer:
    ```sh -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttgapers/cakeqos-merlin/develop/cake-qos.sh)" -s installer
    ```

2.  Configure the install command prompts with the params you want (installer will detect your router model). If you receive any errors (e.g. libnl-tiny package size mismatch) please ensure your Entware instance is up-to-date.

    Change for your linespeed and any overhead (assuming 135Mbit download, 13Mbit upload, "besteffort docsis ack-filter" as optional extra parameters; speeds can also be specified in `Kbit` units).
    
3.  Run CakeQoS with `cake-qos` and use option 1 to start the magic!

3.  To check that CakeQOS-Merlin is running, use `option 3` and/or do a bufferbloat test on [dslreports](https://www.dslreports.com/speedtest)

## Usage

```sh
cake-qos {start|stop|status|settings|update|install|uninstall}
```

-   start:   start cake-qos
-   stop:    stop cake-qos
-   status:   check the current status of cake-qos
